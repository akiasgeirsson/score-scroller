# score-scroller
Music Reader - for scrolling score images

This application loads an image file and moves it across the screen from right to left, over a certain duration period.

Instructions:

first prepare a score file.  

make sure it is a bitmap file, one of these file types: .gif, .jpg, .tga, .png

the program will adjust the size to fit the screen.

start the program: score_scroller_07

choose your image file

adjust the minutes and seconds to the desired duration by clicking and dragging the numbers (down to increase)

if preferred, adjust playhead position

the offset value can be used for practicing certain parts of the piece

press play to start scrolling

press stop to stop


Possible problems:

keep a look at the framerate number, if it is too low then the file is too big or the computer too slow.  

in that case, try other formats, compression or try to match the height of the file to the screen size.
